# Working with Trello

We use a project management platform called [Trello](https://trello.com) to manage article submissions, editing and publication. Each SitePoint editor manages their own Trello board, so while they all operate in roughly the same manner, there are slight differences across the range of boards. Check in with your editor if you are unsure.

## General Guidelines 

Generally authors are added to a given Trello board once they have published one article on the site. This gives authors and editors a chance to make sure they are comfortable working with each other. Editors are in charge of who is added to their board, so if you'd like to be added to more than one board, you'll need to approach each editor individually.

## Trello Board Management

Each editor manages their Trello board in their own way, but generally cards move across the board from the left to right, from the "Topic Suggestions" column to the "Published" column.

### Topic Suggestions

Authors are invited to add pitches to the "Topic Suggestions" column.

Editors review these suggestions, asking you for more information or a more detailed outline where needed.

Once an editor is happy with a topic, they will ask the author to make a start, indicate when they would like a draft by adding a due date to the card (deadlines are very important), and move it to the "In Progress" column.

### Approved Ideas

Editors can also add cards for topics they would like covered to the "Approved Ideas" column. An author interested in taking on the topic is able to submit a pitch. Once the editor is happy with the pitch, they will add the author to the card and set a due date as normal. This column is also used when an author who suggested an article decides they cannot write the piece themselves.

### In Progress

If an article is being placed into Peer Review, a link to the Pull Request should be added to the card. If not, the draft should be attached to the card as a Markdown file.

Depending on whether a channel is using Peer Review to handle article editing, further discussion on an article may happen on GitHub or on the card itself.

### Scheduled

Once an article is to the editor's liking, the editor will upload it to WordPress and schedule it. On Trello, the editor will change the due date to the date of publication and then move the card to the "Scheduled" column, leaving a comment on the card indicating when the article will be published.

### Published

Once an article is published, the editor will move the card to "Published".
