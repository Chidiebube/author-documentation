# Code

Code is one of the elements of an article that our readers will enjoy most and pay most attention to. Therefore, please observe the following:

Unless you are just presenting code concepts, every tutorial should have an associated GitHub repository that is mentioned in the tutorial.

Where possible, you should provide in-article demos. CodePen is the preferred platform, however JSBin is also ok (it's good for displaying console output, for example).

Code should be explained, not just presented as a block. Mention where the code should go, in which file and in which position. Readers should be able to follow the tutorial without knowing what you're thinking.

If there are any extra steps required to get your code working such as utilizing external libraries, then please make sure these are mentioned.

## Formatting and Style

Code should be formatted correctly, as inline code or a code block.

Syntax highlighting should be added to code blocks (not inline code). This is done by preceeding the code block with three backticks and the name of the language and following it with a closing three backticks. You can see an example [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/).

Don't mark up headers as inline code, e.g. ##jQuery.each(), not ##`jQuery.each()`

If you wish to mark up code (e.g. a method name) as a link, don't also mark it up as code. E.g. "jQuery's .each() function" not "jQuery's `.each()` function"

Actions, i.e. 'Click this button', should be _italicized_.

Paths and file names should be in backticks.

HTML tags should include angle brackets, be in lowercase and backticks, e.g. `<div>`, `<img>`.
