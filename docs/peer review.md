# Peer Review

Peer Review is a programme we're running across many of our channels at SitePoint. The goal is to improve the quality of SitePoint's articles, help authors develop their writing and technical skills, and give editors the space to provide important feedback.

This is not a typical scientific peer review – no detailed reviews need to happen and the editor’s word is still final, but we are trying to gather feedback on certain posts before publishing them.

If you would like to write for any of the above channels, you must get familiar with the peer review system – there is no way around it. Fear not, it’s far simpler than it sounds. Below you’ll find some resources common to all channels implementing it. Keep in mind that individual channels may have channel specific instructions that supplement those outlined here.
