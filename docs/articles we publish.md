# Articles We Publish

SitePoint has 10 main channels: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, WordPress, Mobile, Design, Entrepreneur and Web. Each of these channels is distinct, but articles often cover more than one of these topics. For example, an article on responsive design methods could be placed in the HTML/CSS, Mobile, Design and Web channels.

These channels are all run by one or more editors, all of whom are experts in their field. They are also experts in what topics work best for their channel, and the particular strategy and content focus of their channel is up to them. 

However, the focus is always on helping developers improve their skills.

## Article Types

We publish a wide variety of content on SitePoint. Here are a few of the most common types, along with some advice on what works best.

Something that underscores all our content: our audience wants an answer to their questions.

## An Intro to [concept, language, tool, workflow]

These articles are usually aimed at beginners to a given technology or concept. They take the reader through the basics, explaining syntax, workflow or toolset. Typical Intros will lack demos, code examples or example apps.

## Tutorials

Tutorials take a reader through a process, such as (the most common example) building a to-do app, setting up a server, or creating something in Photoshop.

Tutorials should be detailed and provide general information, ie you should be able to learn principles in a tutorial that you can apply to another task. They should also not be too specific - a tutorial on a little-used API or tool is not going to be very popular.

## Listicles

Listicles have an awful reputation, often equated with clickbait and lazy, easy article writing. This is misguided - lazy writing comes in all sorts of formats and there are in-depth, useful listicles just like there are facile, pointless essays and tutorials. (Also, "clickbait" is a problematic term in general, but that's a whole other story.) It's up to the author (and the editor) to make a given article worth reading, no matter the format.

### Listicles have a few advantages over traditional articles:

- Readers go in with clear expectations about the structure and content they're about to read. An article with a defined number of sections or points is more attractive than one whose length and structure is unknown.

- You have more chances to hook a reader in. A reader may know 10 out of 12 of the [12 little-known CSS facts](http://www.sitepoint.com/12-little-known-css-facts/), but they still get some value out of the two facts they've never heard before.

- They are easier to write. Note that this isn't an excuse for lazy writing, but the format does make it easier 

### A few things to keep in mind:

- Once again: Our audience wants an answer to their questions. Don't waste their time. An article promising "5 of the best prototyping apps" is far more attractive than one promising "54 of the best prototyping apps". If a given category is crowded with lots of options, help the reader out by narrowing them down.\

- A listicle format is no excuse for a lazy article absent any insight. In a list of particular apps or platforms, tell a reader _why_ a given option is in the list, explain its pros and cons, and go further than a simple explanation readers could find on Wikipedia or the option's GitHub page.

## What's New?

These are newsy articles covering updates to a platform, language or technology. We have a few ongoing series that are updated every month (covering browser usage statistics and updates to Chrome and Firefox) but generally this format is to be avoided. Articles in this format become out of date quickly, and there isn't the same return on investment as an article covering a subject in more depth. However, ask your editor if you think your "What's New?" pitch may be an exception.

## Q+As

Interviewing prominent developers or leaders in a given field is a great idea. Big names in an area are usually knowledgeable and their presence on the site may attract readers.

### A few tips about interviewing:

- The ideal medium for an interview is a face-to-face discussion. Speaking with someone in real life always provides the most natural discussion and generates the best quotes. The worst interview medium is an email interview, where a subject can edit their answers until they are drained of all spontaneity and genuine sentiment. If you can talk to someone IRL (or by phone if they're far away from you), you should do so. Chatting via IM is a middle-ground between face-to-face and email, so this is to be preferred to email. 

- Take notes and record the interview with your phone (with the interviewee's consent). Related: don't misquote people ;)

- Ask open questions. "How did you feel when X happened?" will produce a much more interesting answer than "Did you feel sad when X happened?" 

- Write down questions beforehand, but don't stick to them too rigidly if the discussion veers towards something more interesting. Having a good number of questions (at least 10 is probably a good number to aim for) means you'll be less stressed about finding things to talk about.

- Treat people fairly. If the subject of the interview is something controversial, make sure you raise all the issues in the interview. An interviewee should have the opportunity to address anything you will be writing in the article. Don't blindside them. A good rule is to ask yourself whether they are likely to be surprised with what the final article looks like. If the answer is yes, you should give them the opportunity to respond to everything in the article.

- Don't be afraid to go back to interviewees to confirm details or ask additional questions. It's a little embarrassing, but it's less embarrassing than getting stuff wrong.

### Formatting interviews

There are two ways to structure an article built around an interview.

- Structure it like a Q+A, with (edited for clarity) questions in bold and the interviewees answers printed below.
- Structure is as a news or feature article, with a mixture of reported speech ("Adam said he was unsure about the apple") and direct quotes ("This apple sucks," he said.) Generally the idea is to explain a point, then follow it up with a supporting quote. This is more difficult to write but can lead to a more compelling article in general.

Either way, the best way to get started is to identify the best quotes, then build the article around them.

## Conference Coverage

If you attend or speak at an interesting conference, you may want to produce an article detailing your experiences. Like the "What's New?" articles mentioned above, these are generally less popular than more in-depth articles on a particular subject.

It's usually best to use ideas raised in the conference as a jumping off point to a wider discussion of a particular topic. A conference featuring a lot of Internet of Things discussions (so, any conference these days) can serve as an introduction to an article exploring practical ways to get started with IoT, or a round-up of the state of the IoT market.

More granular coverage (I went to this talk where the speaker said X, here's a link to the slides) should be avoided, for the most part. If you feel your coverage is an exception, check with your managing editor.
