# Slack

Slack is the primary mode of communication for SitePoint employees, editors, contributors and ambassadors. Slack is an interesting combination of synchronous and asynchronous communication, with elements of email and chat.

If you're interested in joining out Slack team, contact your editor and ask for access.

Feel free to use Slack to message editors and fellow authors. People are happy to chat about tech and other things. (This should go without saying but please avoid using Slack to hound editors about the status of your articles!)

Slack is enormously useful, but it can present challenges. A few tips:

## Manage Your Notifications

If you're not careful, you can find yourself overwhelmed with notifications. Join as many channels as you like, but be aware that many of the channels ("#general", "#random", "#ambassadors" in particular) have dozens or even hundreds of members. Conversation can move quickly, and you can wake up to an inbox full of notification emails and/or hundreds of Slack notifications.

In most cases, it's best to use Slack's notification settings to mute channels whose activity you're only semi-interested in.

It's far better to [set up a collection of "highlight words"](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201398467) and receive alerts whenever those words are used.

## Save Anything Important

We use the free version of Slack, which can only display a maximum of 10,000 messages. When this is exceeded, the older messages are deleted. For anything you would like to refer to again in the future, copy and paste the discussion or use screenshots to move it out of Slack and into somewhere more permanent.

## Don't Be Afraid to Create New Channels

One of the key advantages of Slack is the ability to easily bring a large group of people together into discussions in an ad-hoc way. Don't be afraid to bring more people into a discussion you feel is relevant to them.
