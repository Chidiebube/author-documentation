## Guidelines to being a SitePoint Peer Reviewer

At SitePoint, we endeavour to create articles of the highest standard, and help authors grow. Reviewing helps fellow authors and assists them in publishing quality work. 

Providing feedback is as simple as reading the article and posting your comments on parts you think need to be edited. More on that below.

### What submissions can I review? 
We recommend you pick posts with the least amount of feedback. Generally, look through the pull requests, but prioritize those posts that are still under review. The older they are, the more important it is to review them.

### How do I review?
Below is how you can drop a general comment into a submission:

Below is how to insert a comment on a **specific** part of the article:

**Note:** All of the feedback on a submission is constructive. Please don't take it personally, as authors and editors are there to help the piece be better.

### What to look out for
Here is a quick list of things to keep an eye on when peer reviewing someone else's work: 
- **Report issues:** If you find a technical problem in the article, make the issue known by adding a comment to the draft. If the problem is outside the scope of the repository’s channel, use this [public bug reporting repository](https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/sitepoint-errata).
- **Tag the original author in the comments:** Tagging the original author reminds them to look at your comment. It’s the original author’s responsibility to update their post according to best practices recommended by others, whether this be language fixes, layout fixes, or code fixes.
- **Minor stuff:** If you notice an image has a wrong URL, or a typo, or some formatting errors, no need to open an issue. Fix it and submit a pull request if the article is already merged into master or tag the author if not, everyone will appreciate it.
