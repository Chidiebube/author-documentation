# Images

Images are a very important part of our content at SitePoint. They help break up content, illustrate ideas and concepts, and show what a completed project will look like. Every article should have at least one image.

All images in SitePoint articles should be hosted on our CDN, external images may be deleted at any time and leave us with gaps in our content. Talk to your editor about how they would like images uploaded - some channels, particularly those which use Peer Review, will have you do this yourself by logging into SitePoint's CDN. On other channels, images should be given to the editor for them to upload in the same manner.

The maximum upload size is 2MB, and the maximum image width is 800 pixels, anything larger than that gets resized. Make sure your images are optimized for the web, use JPEG or PNG-8 and try to avoid PNG-24.
