# Plagiarism

Plagiarism is unacceptable and is grounds for immediate removal from the pool of contributors. We use [Plagiarisma](http://plagiarisma.net/) to verify content published on SitePoint has not appeared elsewhere first.

Seriously, don't do it. You will be caught and kicked out of SitePoint's author pool, and it's generally just a pointless, dumb thing to do.
