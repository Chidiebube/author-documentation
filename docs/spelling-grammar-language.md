# Spelling, Grammar and Acceptable Language

All articles published on SitePoint should be free of spelling and grammar mistakes. It's impossible to catch every single typo, but authors should make an effort to make sure their work is to a publishable standard _before_ sending it to their editor. If you spot an error with one of your articles (or an article published by someone else) please let your editor know.

**Note**: All articles should be submitted in markdown.

## Spelling

Please use a spell checker. Typos are common and easily missed, but spell checkers handle the heavy lifting. Spell check won't always catch acronyms and technical terms, so watch out for these.

**Please rememebr: we use US spelling in all our articles.**

## Grammar

### Common "gotchas"

Make sure you understand the difference between:

- it's, its
- your, you're
- there, their, they're
- to, too, two

Company names - When writing about startups, companies and products, check to make sure you have capitalized according to their preferences. For example: SitePoint, WordPress, jQuery, iPhone, GitHub.

Sentences that start with a lowercased company or product, like 'iPhone' or 'jQuery' should retain the style. For example, "iPhones are a very popular product."

Understand that a hyphen is not the same as a long dash.

To quote from [Louis Lazaris' excellent piece on writing](http://www.impressivewebs.com/how-to-write-great-web-development-articles-tutorials/):

>Hyphens are used for math, phone numbers, breaking words onto new lines, in compound words (e.g. “accident-prone” or “five-column grid”), and so on. But they shouldn’t be used at the start of an interjection in a sentence. That’s where you need a long dash. You can copy and paste a real long dash (—), or you can use the character entity, `&mdash;`. Also, most style guides recommend no spaces before and after the long dash, although apparently it’s not a hard-and-fast rule.

### Consistency

Sentences should be consistent in their structure and presentation. For example, if you're listing actions, and the first action is "running", the next one shouldn't be "jump", it should be "jumping" so that it matches the form of the verb.

The same thing can be applied to tenses: "I ran and then jump" is incorrect. "Ran and then jumped," is correct. Read through your sentences and check that each phrase is consistent with what came before.

When it comes to voice, using "we" or "you" is fine as long as the choice is applied consistently for the rest of the article.

## Acceptable Language

As a general rule, gratuitous swearing is not encouraged. Sometimes it works in the context of the article, but it's usually unnecessary and off-putting.

This should be obvious, but never use your article as an opportunity to attack any group or person. Web development tends to separate people into tribes - Ruby vs PHP vs JavaScript - and what is often friendly rivalry sometimes crosses over into tribalism and abuse.

We want everyone to feel welcome at our site, so if you find yourself writing something that may exclude a group, delete it.
