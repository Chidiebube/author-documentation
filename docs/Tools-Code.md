# Displaying Code - Guidelines
---
Code is one of the most important elements of an article. Therefore it is imperative that you pay attention to the following:

- Unless you are just presenting code concepts, every tutorial should have an associated GitHub repository that is mentioned in the tutorial.
- If you are providing in-article demos, we recommend you use platforms like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/) to do so. 
- The code needs to be explained further, Mention where the code should go, in which file and in which position. The reader should be able to follow what you're saying with ease. 
- If there are extra steps required beforehand to get your code working properly, ensure this is mentioned. 

### Formatting and Style
Your code styling should following the requirements below:
- Code should be formatted as inline code or a code block.
- Syntax highlighting should be added to code blocks (not inline code). This is done by preceeding the code block with three backticks and the name of the language and following it with a closing three backticks. You can see an example [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/).
- Don't mark up headers as inline code, e.g. ##jQuery.each(), not `##jQuery.each()`
- If you wish to mark up code (e.g. a method name) as a link, don't also mark it up as code. E.g. "jQuery's .each() function" not "jQuery's `.each()` function"
- Actions, i.e. 'Click this button', should be *italicized*.
- Paths and file names should be in backticks.
- HTML tags should include angle brackets, be in lowercase and backticks, e.g. <div>, <img>.
