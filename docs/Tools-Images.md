# Using Images in your article

Images are very important in an article because they break up the content and illustrate ideas in a visual format. Every article should have at least one image. 

All images in SitePoint articles should be hosted on our CDN. Images for article come about in three ways:
- The editor will have you add the image yourself by logging into SitePoint's CDN.
- Images are given to the editor for them to upload into the article. 
- SitePoint has their own in-house graphic designer, so some editors will have an image created from scratch.

**Image Specifications:** 
- The maximum upload size is 2MB
- The maximum image width is 800 pixels, anything larger than that gets resized. 
- Make sure your images are optimized for the web, use JPEG or PNG-8 and try to avoid PNG-24.
