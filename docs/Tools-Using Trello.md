# What is Trello?
---
[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a project management platform that our editors use to manage article submissions, editing and publication. When you have published one article on the site and editor trusts your writing ability, you will be invited to their Trello board.

### Trello Board Management
There are generally 5 stages in an editor's Trello board, although individual editors may run their boards differently according to their personal preferences. They are:

1. **Topic Suggestions**: Authors are invited to add pitches to the "Topic Suggestions" column. Editors will then review it. If they like the pitch, they will ask the author to make a start, indicate when they would like a draft by adding a deadline to the card, and move it to the "In Progress" column.

2. **Approved Ideas**: If an article idea is pitched by an author but cannot write it themselves, editors will move the pitch into this column. Other authors are welcome to see it and express interest to write the article. 

3. **In Progress**: If an article is being placed into Peer Review, a link to the Pull Request should be added to the card. If not, the draft should be attached to the card as a Markdown file. Depending on whether a channel is using Peer Review to handle article editing, further discussion on an article may happen on GitHub or on the card itself. If a topic has been sitting in this column for a while you are welcome to take over, but you must consult the editor first as the original author may have a special arrangement with them.

4. **Scheduled**: Once an article is to the editor's liking, the editor will upload it to WordPress and schedule it. The editor will then move the card to this Trello column, along with the date the article is scheduled to publish.

5. **Published**: When an article is published, the editor will move the card into this column to indicate the article's completion.
