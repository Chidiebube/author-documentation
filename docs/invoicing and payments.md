# Invoicing SitePoint

It's our privilege to work with such a huge, diverse group of talented contributors, and we love being able to pay them for their time, effort and experience.

If you've contributed to SitePoint, here's how to get paid.

## Instructions

General invoicing instructions are available [here](http://www.sitepoint.com/invoicing-sitepoint/), please follow them and everything will (probably) be fine.

## Payment Frequency

We typically send out payments once every 14 days, and we tell contributors to expect payments in 10 business days. There are also additional delays that occur with transactions

## What to do if things aren't fine

First, make sure it's been at least 10 business days since you submitted your invoice. Quite often, when someone contacts us to inquire about their lack of payment, the answer is that the payment is about to go out, or is pending.

Assuming you've waited a reasonable length of time, contact [Tom Trumble](mailto:tom.trumble@sitepoint.com), who handles our invoicing and payments along with our finance team. Please don't re-submit an invoice until we ask you to.
