# Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is the primary tool of communications for SitePoint employees, editors and contributors. 

You can use this tool to message editors and fellow authors. **However,** do not use Slack to hound editors about the status of your article.

If you're interested in joining our Slack team, contact your editor and ask for access.

If you're new to Slack, make sure you read the information below to get the most out of the tool.

### Manage Your Notifications
There are many channels in our Slack that you can join (eg: "#general", "#random", the list goes on). Some conversations move rapidly, and there are instances where you might wake up to dozens of Slack notifications.

To avoid this dilemma, only join important channels or mute the ones you are only semi-interested in. This can be done via the settings option on your channel. 

### Save Anything Important
We use the free version of Slack, which can only display a maximum of 10,000 messages. When this is exceeded, the older messages are deleted. For anything you would like to refer to again in the future, copy and paste the discussion or use screenshots to move it out of Slack and into somewhere more permanent.

### Don't Be Afraid to Create New Channels
One of the key advantages of Slack is the ability to easily bring a large group of people together into discussions in an ad-hoc way. Don't be afraid to (respectfully) bring more people into a discussion you feel is relevant to them.
