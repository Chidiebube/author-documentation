# Pitching Your Articles

Experience has taught us that people write best when they write about something they are passionate about. That's why we generally encourage authors to pitch us with ideas they would like to write about. 

Experience has also taught us that most articles benefit from feedback from an outside source, particularly at the early stages. That's why we don't accept complete drafts written before we've had a chance to provide feedback.

Here's what we look for in a pitch:

- A clear and concise description of the topic you'd like to cover. Generally, if you can't suggest a short title for the article, you probably haven't got a handle on what the article is about.

- A short explanation of what exactly the article will cover. We need every article to have an outline explaining what the article will contain, usually a bulletpoint list will do. Feel free to provide this at the pitching stage.

- A sentence explaining why the article should be written. Is the article about an emerging technology or a new trend? Does it cover a solution to a common issue for developers?

Optional, but nice to have:

- A sentence explaining why you are the person to cover this subject.
- Links to sources
- An indication of when you might have this article produced, should it be accepted.
