# Article Tiers

## We have five main tiers of articles: 

- **Quick tips** are bite-sized articles that are highly focused on a specific technique or approach. They're targeted at what we know readers are searching for and are a way to answer their questions quickly. For more information on quick tips, [visit the documentation](quick-tips.md)

- **Regular articles** are short articles (~800 to 1,500 words) covering a technology, a new product or service, something new and interesting happening on the web, etc. 

- **Tutorials** are typically longer (~1500 to 2000 words) more in-depth and can include code samples, downloadable examples, several images or video content. In less technical channels, it can be harder to determine what constitutes a tutorial â€” any confusion, ask your editor.

- **Regular contributors** have arranged a set fee for their articles.

- **Sponsored articles** are articles undertaken in partnership with a sponsor. Generally these are approached the same way as a normal article, but the sponsor has input into the direction and focus of the piece. The turnaround for these articles is usually shorter than for other articles, and the content is subject to sponsor feedback. For these reasons, we pay authors more for these articles. 

## A few words about word counts

Authors (and editors) are often keen to know how long an article should be. This is understandable, as "length" is often used as an indirect way of determining "quality". While we've outlined _typical_ word counts for the types of content we commission above, in reality every article is different, and it would be unwise to aim for a word count too closely. 

We're looking for quality, in-depth articles that teach a reader something significant, useful and unique. Word count is part of the calculation, but so are other factors, like the amount of research completed, the strength of your argument (if applicable), and the quality of your writing.
